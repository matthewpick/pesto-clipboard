# Why did I create this?

- I've used Copy 'Em Paste for years, but wanted something more barebones
  - No multi-device sync
- Ability to recommend to friends / coworkers without having to pay for yet-another-tool
- Wanted something fully open-source that could be audited by myself and others
- Easy to install using brew (no app store)
